# Motivation

Authoring an automated program verifier is a complex task that can be broken up into two
major components with separate concerns. One component is the _front end_, which prescribes the
proof obligations for any given source program. The other component is the _back end_, which
uses algorithms that try to discharge these proof obligations. The front end is concerned
with _what_ the proof obligations are (for the source language at hand), whereas the back end is
concerned with _how_ to discharge the proof obligations. The front end and back end are joined
at an Intermediate Verification Language (IVL). For the front-end author, the IVL becomes a
thinking tool that suggests ways to prescribe the kinds of verification conditions that commonly
arise in a program verifier. For the back-end author, the IVL provides a primitive and precise
foundation upon which to build its algorithms.

The back end makes use of a set of cooperating decision procedures or semi-decision procedures,
each of which is equipped to handle a particular domain (e.g., linear integer arithmetic). Such
decision procedures are provided in off-the-shelf Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers.
The back end works by turning the proof obligations prescribed by a given IVL program into
queries posed to one or several SMT solvers (henceforth referred to as just the _solver_).

In the last 25 years, IVLs have been used effectively in dozens of automated program
verifiers. Widely used IVLs include [Boogie](https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie/),
[Why3](https://www.why3.org/), and [Viper](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/viper.html).
For example, the verifier for the [Dafny](https://dafny.org) programming language has,
since its creation in 2008, used the Boogie&nbsp;2 IVL and tool. This long experience has developed
several patterns of prescribing proof obligations that are not well supported by Boogie&nbsp;2.
